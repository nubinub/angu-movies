## Project initialization

* I used `angular-cli` to initialize the project. This is the recommanded tool on [official documentation](https://angular.io/cli).
* Added angular-routing as the problem clearly stated the need for a list page and detail page.
* Chosing SCSS style sheet format, as I'll definitely enjoy a CSS pre-processor and I prefer the CSS-like syntax.

## CI initialization

* Using existing `mayurrawte/github-angular-actions` to run build and test on every push.
